<p style="color:pink"><b> Ranchi is the capital of the Indian state of Jharkhand and 4th Largest city of India by area. Ranchi was the centre of 
the Jharkhand movement, which called for a separate state for the tribal regions of South Bihar, northern Orissa, western West Bengal and the eastern area of what is present-day Chhattisgarh. 
The Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 by carving out the Bihar divisions of Chota Nagpur and Santhal Parganas. Ranchi has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be 
developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission.

Ranchi district is one among the twenty-four districts of the state of Jharkhand in Eastern India. This region was under the control of the Magadha Empire, then it was a part of the
Mauryan Empire under Ashoka and later a part of the Gupta Empire. After the fall of the Gupta Empire a legendary king named Phanimukut established the Nagvanshi dynasty and 
controlled the Chota Nagpur plateau region for several centuries thereafter.
