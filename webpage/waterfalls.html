 <h3 style="color:pink"><b>Ranchi: City of Waterfalls</b></h3>

   <p style="color:pink">
 Ranchi is considered to be one of the most popular picnic spots or tourist destinations,
 especially in summer, due to the number of beautiful waterfalls in and around the city.

<li><h2><b><u>Dassam Falls</u></b></h2>
 The Dassam Falls is situated at 34 km from the city of Ranchi on Ranchi-Tata road near the Taimara village.
 The place is also known as Dassam Garh. The major water source of this waterfall is River Kachni, which falls
 here from an altitude of 144 feet. The unique feature of this fall is that when the waterfall is seen, 10 water
 streams are also seen falling.</li>


<li><h2><b><u>Jonha Falls</u></b></h2>
 Jonha falls is smaller than the above three ones, but it is also a beautiful waterfall. It is located about 45km
 away from the Ranchi city, but is only at a distance of 30km from the Hundru falls as both are near the same Ranchi-Purulia
 highway. Jonha is also known as Gautam Dhara as once Gautam Buddha spent some time here.</li>


<li><h2><b><u>Hirni Falls</u></b></h2>
 It is the third most popular waterfall in the Indian state Jharkhand. Its height is only 37m, but the good thing is that unlike
 Hundru and Dassam, you do not need to climb any stairs here. The fall is visible from the ground level.</li>
  

<li><h2><b><u>Hundru Falls</u></b></h2>
 This fall is located very near to the capital city Ranchi. Once upon a time in undivided Bihar, Ranchi used to be the summer capital
 of Bihar beacuse it was like a hill station that time. This fall is in the course of the Suvarnarekha river and about 98 meters high.
 The fall is around 45km away from the main city, but you will have to hire your own vehicle because no public transport is available
 to exactly reach the waterfall.</li>
